# For all the DUNE fans!

Production Challenge where you need to collect Melange Spice to survive.

---

### Your task as Governor of Dune:

- You need to collect Melange Spice to satisfy the Empire. - Deliver it to the Palace.
- You can only build on floors like Stone or Concrete.
- You get a "Worker" every two minutes. Most buildings need a worker, so choose what you build.
- You get a reward if you complete the goal. - Will be placed in the Palace.
- You can't skip to the next goal, you have to wait for the time to run out.
- If you don't make your goal, you don't lose, but the enemy will start to attack you, so get that shipment done!

The best way to collect Melange Spice is by using Spice Harvesters. Dune is a dry desert planet... look for Oasis to collect water!
